        Plane 0 and 1 consists of 32x32 tile data. Window Plane has 28x28 tiles.
        Each tile is 2 bytes long, as follows:

        Bits 0-10 : 11-bit index of the tile in Tile Table
               11 : Horizontal flip (0-no flip, 1-flip)
               12 : Vertical flip
            13-14 : Palette (0 to 3)
               15 : Priority

        The first 11 bits indicate the index location where is the tile in the
    Tile Table. See "Tiles.txt" to see how this index is calculated.
        The bits 11 and 12 indicate if the tile will be flipped horizontally,
    vertically of both.
        The bits 13 and 14 indicate the palette used to display the tile.
        The bit 15 indicates the priority of the tile. It this bit is set, then
    the tile will be placed in front of everything on the screen.

       Plane 0 is at memory location $011010 and is 2KB long.
       Plane 1 is at memory location $011810 and is 2KB long.
       Window Plane is at memory location $012010 and is 1568 bytes long.

	   The rendering order is: Plane 0, Plane 1, Sprites, Window Plane.
	   If a tile in Plane 0 has the priority bit set, it will be put in front of
	Plane 1 and Sprites, but not in front of Window Plane. If a tile in Plane 0
	has the priority bit set, it will be put in front of Sprites, but not of the
	Window Plane. The Window Plane will be in front of everything.
