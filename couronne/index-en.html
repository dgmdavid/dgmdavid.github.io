DGM Couronne is a brazilian software, freeware, developed by David Maziero (<A HREF="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/dgmsofthp">DGM Soft</A>).
<BR>
<BR>

The game consists in twenty discs, 10 of <FONT COLOR=GREEN>green</FONT> and 10 of <FONT COLOR=RED>red</FONT>
on a table.

At the start of the game, each player receive a colour; the player's objective is to clear the
table of his respective colour, by using a <FONT COLOR=#B0B000>yellow</FONT> cue disc that must
be placed at the red line.<BR><BR>

The first shoot is always of the <FONT COLOR=GREEN>green</FONT> player.<BR>

Player will continue to play until:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - his shoot does not put any disc of his colour in a hole;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - his shoot did put an opponent's disc in a hole;<BR><BR>

 If the <FONT COLOR=#B0B000>yellow</FONT> disc be put in the hole, and there are less than 10 discs
of player's colour on the table, 1 disc of this colour will be put back on the table.<BR><BR>

The game will end when one player clear all of his discs from the table.<BR><BR>

However, the game can result in a draw, in case of a player put, in the last shoot,
the last two discs of different colours in the hole. In that case, the players will play again.<BR>
